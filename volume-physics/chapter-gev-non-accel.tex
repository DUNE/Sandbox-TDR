\section{Nucleon decay}
\label{sec:nonaccel-ndk}

\subsection{Predictions from Grand Unified Theories and current experimental status}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-status}

\begin{description}
\item[Predictions and experimental status:] Plot or table with partial lifetime predictions for dominant NDK channels in selected GUT theories, together with current limits for each channel.
\end{description}

\subsection{Experimental signatures for nucleon decay searches in DUNE}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-dune}

\begin{description}
\item[Impact of nuclear effects:] Plot showing MC truth multiplicity and kinetic energy distributions of particles exiting Ar nucleus for selected nucleon decay modes. Before/after final state interactions in Ar nucleus.
\item[Relevant backgrounds:] Plot or table illustrating event rates for atmospheric neutrino and cosmic ray muon interactions in the DUNE FD and surrounding material.
\item[Experimental signature:] Event display of reconstructed 3D hits in LAr for selected nucleon decay events.
\item[Event reconstruction and classification performance:] plots illustrating DUNE-specific strengths for NDK searches. Important quantities to show for selected NDK modes may include: track/shower reconstruction efficiency as a function of KE, invariant mass resolution, spatial resolution for displaced vertices, $e/\gamma/\mu/\pi/K/p$ separation, example of DNN-based classification performance.  
\end{description}

\subsection{Sensitivity to $p\to\bar{\nu}K^+$ decay}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-nubarkplus}

\begin{description}
\item[Selection:] Plot or table illustrating $p\to\bar{\nu}K^+$ event selection, and corresponding signal efficiency and background rates.
\item[Sensitivity:] Plot of $p\to\bar{\nu}K^+$ partial lifetime sensitivity versus exposure, or versus years.
\end{description}

\subsection{Sensitivity to other key nucleon decay modes}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-other}

\begin{description}
\item[Sensitivity:] Plot or table summarising signal efficiency, background rate, and sensitivity at fixed exposure for other selected nucleon decay modes. Important other modes to highlight: proton to charged lepton plus neutral kaon, proton to charged lepton plus unflavored neutral meson.
\end{description}


\subsection{Detector requirements for nucleon decay searches}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-requirements}

\begin{description}
